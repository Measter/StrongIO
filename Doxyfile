# The default value is: My Project.

# The default value is: NO.

INTERNAL_DOCS          = YES

# If the CASE_SENSE_NAMES tag is set to NO then doxygen will only generate file
# names in lower-case letters. If set to YES, upper-case letters are also

# If the SORT_MEMBERS_CTORS_1ST tag is set to YES then doxygen will sort the

# Note: If SORT_BRIEF_DOCS is set to NO this option is ignored for sorting brief

# Configuration options related to warning and progress messages

# Configuration options related to the input files

# documented source files. You may enter file names like myfile.cpp or
# directories like /usr/src/myproject. Separate the files or directories with
# spaces. See also FILE_PATTERNS and EXTENSION_MAPPING
# Note: If this tag is empty the current directory is searched.

INPUT                  = ./include/

#
# Note that for custom extensions or not directly supported extensions you also
# need to set EXTENSION_MAPPING for the extension otherwise the files are not
# read by doxygen.
#
# If left blank the following patterns are tested:*.c, *.cc, *.cxx, *.cpp,

# Configuration options related to source browsing
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# If the SOURCE_BROWSER tag is set to YES then a list of source files will be

# If the CLANG_ASSISTED_PARSING tag is set to YES then doxygen will use the
# clang parser (see: http://clang.llvm.org/) for more accurate parsing at the
# cost of reduced performance. This can be particularly helpful with template
# rich C++ code for which doxygen's built-in parser lacks the necessary type
# information.
# Note: The availability of this option depends on whether or not doxygen was
# generated with the -Duse_libclang=ON option for CMake.
# The default value is: NO.

CLANG_ASSISTED_PARSING = YES

# Configuration options related to the HTML output
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# If the HTML_DYNAMIC_SECTIONS tag is set to YES then the generated HTML

# page has loaded.
# The default value is: NO.
# This tag requires that the tag GENERATE_HTML is set to YES.

HTML_DYNAMIC_SECTIONS  = YES

# The GENERATE_TREEVIEW tag is used to specify whether a tree-like index
# structure should be generated to display hierarchical information. If the tag
# value is set to YES, a side panel will be generated containing a tree-like
# index structure (just like the one that is generated for HTML Help). For this
# to work a browser that supports JavaScript, DHTML, CSS and frames is required
# (i.e. any modern browser). Windows users are probably better off using the
# HTML help feature. Via custom style sheets (see HTML_EXTRA_STYLESHEET) one can
# further fine-tune the look of the index. As an example, the default style
# sheet generated by doxygen has an example that shows how to put an image at
# the root of the tree instead of the PROJECT_NAME. Since the tree basically has
# the same information as the tab index, you could consider setting
# DISABLE_INDEX to YES when enabling this option.
# The default value is: NO.
# This tag requires that the tag GENERATE_HTML is set to YES.

# If the COMPACT_LATEX tag is set to YES, doxygen generates more compact LaTeX

COMPACT_LATEX          = NO

# The PAPER_TYPE tag can be used to set the paper type that is used by the
# printer.

# The default value is: YES.

ENABLE_PREPROCESSING   = YES

# The PREDEFINED tag can be used to specify one or more macro names that are
# defined before the preprocessor is started (similar to the -D option of e.g.
# gcc). The argument of the tag is a list of macros of the form: name or
# name=definition (no spaces). If the definition and the "=" are omitted, "=1"
# is assumed. To prevent a macro definition from being undefined via #undef or
# recursively expanded use the := operator instead of the = operator.
